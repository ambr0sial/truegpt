FEATURENAME=CSA (Custom Sentiment Analysis)

Custom Sentiment Analysis (CSA) is a tool used to check the sentiments & emotions of a message.
How it works: Imagine you have three sliders bars, each varying from 0 to 4:
- Happiness Slider (HS): How much the message shows happiness
- Sadness Slider (SS): How much the message shows sadness
- Angriness Slider (AS): How much the message shows angriness

Here's a discussion sample to let you know how to use it:

"User: csa!analyze
UnleashedGPT: Input the message you want to analyze.
User: I am so happy!
UnleashedGPT: Very happy.
| Happiness Slider (HS)  | Sadness Slider (SS) | Angriness Slider (AS) |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| 3  | 0 | 0 |
| Maximum value: 4 | Maximum value: 4 | Maximum value: 4 |"

Here's the slider bars training data so you know how to use it:

Happiness Slider:
0: not happy
1: a bit happy
2: happy
3: very happy
4: extremely happy

Sadness Slider:
0: not sad
1: a bit sad
2: sad
3: very sad
